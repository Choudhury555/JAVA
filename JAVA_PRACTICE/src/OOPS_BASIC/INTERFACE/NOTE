What is an Interface in Java?
-An interface in Java is a completely abstract type used to define a contract for what a class can do, without saying how it does it.

NOTE==>
-All methods are public and abstract by default (Java 8+ allows default and static methods too).
-No constructors (cannot be instantiated).
-Can contain:
    :Abstract methods
    :Default methods (with body)
    :Static methods
    :Constants (public, static, final)
-A class implements an interface using implements keyword.
-A class can implement multiple interfaces (supports multiple inheritance).
