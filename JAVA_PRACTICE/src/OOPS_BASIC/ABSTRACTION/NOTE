==>What is an Abstract Class in Java?
ANS==>An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated (you can't create objects from it). It is meant to be inherited by other classes and usually contains abstract methods (methods without a body) as well as concrete methods (methods with implementation).


NOTE==>
Use the abstract keyword.
-It can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
-It can have constructors, fields, and static methods.
-Cannot be instantiated directly.
-Must be extended by a subclass which implements all abstract methods.


When to Use Abstract Class==>
-When you want to provide a base template for other classes.
-When multiple classes share some code but also need to implement their own versions of certain methods.
-Prefer abstract class when thereâ€™s a strong is-a relationship and shared logic (vs. interface which is purely contract-based).
